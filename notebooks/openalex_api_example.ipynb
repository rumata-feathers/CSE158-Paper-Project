      "Authors: ['M. Shoji']\n",
      "Date: 2020-06-08\n",
      "Abstract: Radiation resistant camera system was constructed for monitoring deuterium plasma discharges in the Large Helical Device (LHD). This system has contributed to safe operation during two experimental campaigns without serious problems due to radiation (neutrons and gamma-rays). The cameras steadily functioned even in the plasma discharge with the maximum neutron emission rate in FY 2017, though some bright specks temporarily appeared on the images. The cameras have been installed in shield boxes which consist of lead boxes covered with 10% borated polyethylene blocks in all directions. For optimizing the design of the shield box, the radiation flux distribution was calculated by MCNP-6 code, which reveals the reduction of the radiation flux and the change of the energy spectra in the shield box. Thanks to the optimization, significant extension of the lifetime of the cameras has been realized. Investigation of the influence of the radiation on the CCD image sensor shows that the number of bright specks generally increases with the radiation flux to the camera, which also indicates that some bright specks disappear by the self-annealing process on the image sensor. This phenomenon also highly contributes to the further extension of the lifetime of the radiation resistant cameras.\n",

      "Abstract: Since 1922 when Wu proposed the use of the Folin phenol reagent for the measurement of proteins (l), a number of modified analytical procedures ut.ilizing this reagent have been reported for the determination of proteins in serum (2-G), in antigen-antibody precipitates (7-9), and in insulin (10).Although the reagent would seem to be recommended by its great sensitivity and the simplicity of procedure possible with its use, it has not found great favor for general biochemical purposes.In the belief that this reagent, nevertheless, has considerable merit for certain application, but that its peculiarities and limitations need to be understood for its fullest exploitation, it has been studied with regard t.o effects of variations in pH, time of reaction, and concentration of reactants, permissible levels of reagents commonly used in handling proteins, and interfering subst.ances.Procedures are described for measuring protein in solution or after precipitation wit,h acids or other agents, and for the determination of as little as 0.2 y of protein.

      "Abstract: Actualmente diversas investigaciones se han enfocado en analizar a partir de videos de alta velocidad, características de las descargas eléctricas atmosféricas con el fin de adquirir mejor comprensión del fenómeno, que conlleva entre otros aspectos el desarrollo de sistemas de protección robustos. La mayoría de las investigaciones han requerido de un observador que ante el suceso del evento provea un disparo manual a la cámara permitiendo almacenar la información visual del fenómeno. Por tanto, este trabajo se orientó en proponer una metodología para la detección de las descargas utilizando dos implementaciones basadas en procesamiento de señales y visión computacional, con el propósito que el sistema autónomamente sea el que suministre el disparo, apartando al observador de la realización de esta tarea. El sistema de detección basado en técnicas de procesamiento de imágenes requirió la adecuación de métodos de segmentación, representación, descripción y clasificación. El algoritmo de reconocimiento con visión computacional se implementó mediante la red neuronal convolucional EfficientNetB4. Fuera de línea, las técnicas basadas en procesamiento de imágenes suministraron una precisión del 81.81%, mientras que haciendo uso de visión computacional la precisión fue de 71.63%. Con el objeto de evaluar el desempeño en tiempo real, las técnicas de procesamiento se adaptaron en un ordenador de placa reducida correspondiente a la Raspberry Pi 3 modelo B+ obteniéndose una precisión de 86.95%. Adicionalmente, se evaluó la característica de multiplicidad la cual corresponde al número de descargas subsecuentes presentes en el canal de la descarga logrando una precisión de 66.66%.

      "Abstract: Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically ﬂexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and ﬂexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.\n",

      "Abstract: Molecular Cloning has served as the foundation of technical expertise in labs worldwide for 30 years. No other manual has been so popular, or so influential. Molecular Cloning, Fourth Edition, by the celebrated founding author Joe Sambrook and new co-author, the distinguished HHMI investigator Michael Green, preserves the highly praised detail and clarity of previous editions and includes specific chapters and protocols commissioned for the book from expert practitioners at Yale, U Mass, Rockefeller University, Texas Tech, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Washington University, and other leading institutions. The theoretical and historical underpinnings of techniques are prominent features of the presentation throughout, information that does much to help trouble-shoot experimental problems. For the fourth edition of this classic work, the content has been entirely recast to include nucleic-acid based methods selected as the most widely used and valuable in molecular and cellular biology laboratories. Core chapters from the third edition have been revised to feature current strategies and approaches to the preparation and cloning of nucleic acids, gene transfer, and expression analysis. They are augmented by 12 new chapters which show how DNA, RNA, and proteins should be prepared, evaluated, and manipulated, and how data generation and analysis can be handled. The new content includes methods for studying interactions between cellular components, such as microarrays, next-generation sequencing technologies, RNA interference, and epigenetic analysis using DNA methylation techniques and chromatin immunoprecipitation. To make sense of the wealth of data produced by these techniques, a bioinformatics chapter describes the use of analytical tools for comparing sequences of genes and proteins and identifying common expression patterns among sets of genes.

      "Date: 1996-10-15\n",
      "Abstract: We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order ${\\mathit{N}}_{\\mathrm{atoms}}^{3}$ operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ``metric'' and a special ``preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order ${\\mathit{N}}_{\\mathrm{atoms}}^{2}$ scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach ${\\mathit{N}}_{\\mathrm{atoms}}$. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. \\textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.\n",

      "Abstract: Abstract This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied &lt;2‐fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.\n",

      "Date: 1995-01-01\n",
      "Abstract: SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.\n",

Phys. 96, 2155 (1992)], we believe that further improvements are unlikely unless exact-exchange information is considered. Arguments to support this view are presented, and a semiempirical exchange-correlation functional containing local-spin-density, gradient, and exact-exchange terms is tested on 56 atomization energies, 42 ionization potentials, 8 proton affinities, and 10 total atomic energies of first- and second-row systems. This functional performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only, and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.\n",

      "Abstract: This article examines the adequacy of the \"rules of thumb\" conventional cutoff criteria and several new alternatives for various fit indexes used to evaluate model fit in practice. Using a 2‐index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)‐based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML‐based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true‐population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2‐index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true‐population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML‐based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true‐population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.\n",

Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle-Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.\n",

We present DESeq2 , a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates.

      "Abstract: Most poetry is not 'poetry'. Artfully assembled words are everywhere affecting human consciousness, from billboards and passing busses, to the endless stream of internet memes. 'Poetry' – for its own sake – is held aloft like a waiter's dish. Today, the chef's speciality is spoken word. What has hitherto been considered an emerging and countercultural art form, has recently become content for marketing departments. (Lazell) In doing so, it has simultaneously reached the audiences it has long been denied and marinated in the sullied waters of consumer capitalism. Is this a milestone of poetic achievement or, as the Old Testament might put it, a sin for which the poet should have 'a large millstone hung around their neck' and 'drowned in the depths of the sea'?\n",

      "Abstract: In report 6 of the BEPS action plan, Preventing the Granting of Treaty Benefits in Inappropriate Circumstances, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) proposes (amongst others) to include a principal purpose test (PPT) in tax treaties. Under this test a treaty benefit shall not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction (subjective test), unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty (objective test). The subjective test is, from the viewpoint of the tax authorities a relatively ‘easy’ test. The objective test, however, can provide for some relief for taxpayers. In this article the PPT is being investigated and discussed. Especially, attention is given to the objective test. An attempt is being made to develop practical guidance to interpret the PPT, based on Dutch case law and doctrine.\n",

      "Abstract: To determine the basic relations for photoplasticity using cellulose acetate, the effect of the strain rate as well as temperature on mechanical and optical properties were investigated in detail. As a result, although the behavior of cellulose acetate depends essentially on viscosity, the uniaxial stress-strain-optic law of it could be uniquely represented in their nondimensional forms in terms of yield stress, yield fringe order and yield strain, regardless of the strain rate and temperature, where yield stress and yield fringe order were linearly related to both temperature and the logarithm of the strain rate. Validity of this uniaxial stress-strain-optic law was confirmed under a biaxial stress field. Moreover, it was found that the value of the strain rate could be determined by the fringe order rate. Therefore, the empirical formulas considering the influence of the strain rate were obtained for photoplastic plane stress analysis during usual static loading.\n",

      "Abstract: We previously reported that monoclonal antibodies to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and other membrane-impermeant PDI inhibitors prevented HIV-1 infection. PDI is present at the surface of HIV-1 target cells and reduces disulfide bonds in a model peptide attached to the cell membrane. Here we show that soluble PDI cleaves disulfide bonds in recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp120 and that gp120 bound to the surface receptor CD4 undergoes a disulfide reduction that is prevented by PDI inhibitors. Concentrations of inhibitors that prevent this reduction and inhibit the cleavage of surface-bound disulfide conjugate prevent infection at the level of HIV-1 entry. The entry of HIV-1 strains differing in their coreceptor specificities is similarly inhibited, and so is the reduction of gp120 bound to CD4 of coreceptor-negative cells. PDI inhibitors also prevent HIV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion but have no effect on the entry of HIV-1 pseudo-typed with murine leukemia virus envelope. Importantly, PDI coprecipitates with both soluble and cellular CD4. We propose that a PDI.CD4 association at the cell surface enables PDI to reach CD4-bound virus and to reduce disulfide bonds present in the domain of gp120 that binds to CD4. Conformational changes resulting from the opening of gp120-disulfide loops may drive the processes of virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. The biochemical events described identify new potential targets for anti-HIV agents.\n",

Zudem werden Erkenntnisse einer quantitativen Teilstudie des Schul-Barometers (www.Schul-Barometer.net) diskutiert, basierend auf Erfahrungen schulischer Mitarbeitender im Umgang mit dem Krieg in der Schule und den ankommenden Schüler*innen aus der Ukraine. Deutlich ist, dass es vieler Ressourcen (u.a. personelle und digitale) für die Integration dieser Schüler*innen bedarf. Das Fehlen von Ressourcen führt zu hohen Belastungen schulischer Akteur*innen. Um Prioritäten zu setzen, braucht es eine systematische Betrachtung von Kapazität(sgrenz)en sowie notwendigen und vorhandenen Ressourcen, die je nach Schulstandort variieren können.\n",

The purpose is to show the practical applicability of “the thin steel plate with crack as the Sacrificial Test Piece” for monitoring the fatigue damage parameters on bridge members. In this research, it is decided that the applicable range of crack length and the crack propagation properties of the thin steel plate to evaluate the fatigue damage parameter are obtained. And it is suggested that the fatigue damage parameter under constant amplitude loading can be estimated by the thin steel plate with practical accuracy.\n",

      "Abstract: Existing literature suggest that learning occur at three levels: individual, team and organizational. Although there have been theoretical models at all three levels, the research efforts to integrate them are limited. This paper proposes a team learning model that integrates previous learning theories at different levels. The model was then used to explain how to overcome learning barriers in various aspects of modern manufacturing system design.\n",

      "Abstract: Abusive shaking of infants has been asserted as a primary cause of subdural bleeding, cerebral edema/brain swelling, and retinal hemorrhages.Manual shaking of biofidelic mannequins, however, has failed to generate the rotational accelerations believed necessary to cause these intracranial symptoms in the human infant.This study examines the apparent contradiction between the accepted model and reported biomechanical results.Researchers collected linear and angular motion data from an infant anthropomorphic test device during shaking and during various activities of daily life, as well as from a 7-monthold boy at play in a commercial jumping toy.Results were compared among the experimental conditions and against accepted injury thresholds.Rotational accelerations during shaking of a biofidelic mannequin were consistent with previous published studies and also statistically indistinguishable from the accelerations endured by a normal 7-month-old boy at play.The rotational accelerations during non-contact shaking appear to be tolerated by normal infants, even when repetitive.\n",
